## Summary

As the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) feature evolves, cluster administrators require a privileged mode to grant access to devices already in use by other users. This feature, referred to as DRAAdminAccess, allows administrators to perform tasks such as monitoring device health or status while maintaining device security and integrity.

This KEP proposes a mechanism for cluster administrators to mark a request in a ResourceClaim or ResourceClaimTemplate with an admin access flag. This flag allows privileged access to devices, enabling administrative tasks without compromising security. Access to this mode is restricted to users authorized to create ResourceClaim or ResourceClaimTemplate objects in namespaces marked with the DRA admin label, ensuring that non-administrative users cannot misuse this feature.


## Motivation

The current Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) feature enables users to request resources but lacks a mechanism for cluster administrators to gain privileged access to devices already in use by other users. This limitation restricts administrators from performing tasks like:

* Monitoring device health or status.

* Performing diagnostics and troubleshooting on devices shared across users.

Enabling such administrative tasks without compromising security is critical to cluster operations. Non-admin users gaining access to devices in use by others could result in:

* Unauthorized access to confidential information about device usage.

* Potential conflicts or misuse of shared hardware.

As the adoption of DRA expands, the lack of privileged administrative access becomes a bottleneck for cluster operations, particularly in shared environments where devices are critical resources.

### Goals

* Provide a privileged mode for cluster administrators to access devices already in use.

* Ensure that only authorized users can use the privileged mode.

* Maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to devices.

* Allow administrators to mark `ResourceClaim` or `ResourceClaimTemplate` objects with an admin access flag in namespaces marked with the DRA admin label.

### Non-Goals

* Redesign DRA.

* Extend privileged mode access to non-admin users.

* Define how administrators use the data accessed through privileged mode.

## Proposal

### DRAAdminAccess Overview

This proposal enhances the `DRAAdminAccess` feature to enable cluster administrators to mark requests in `ResourceClaim` and `ResourceClaimTemplate` objects as privileged. This feature includes:

1. Admin Access Flag:

    A field in `ResourceClaim` and `ResourceClaimTemplate` specifications to indicate the request is in admin mode.

    Example:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: ResourceClaim
    metadata:
      name: admin-resource-claim
      namespace: admin-namespace
    spec:
      resourceClassName: admin-resource-class
      adminAccess: true
    ```
1. Namespace Label for DRA Admin Mode:

    Namespaces must be labeled to allow the creation of admin-access claims.

    Example label:
    ```yaml
    metadata:
      labels:
        kubernetes.io/dra-admin-access: "true"
    ```
1. Authorization Check:

    In the REST storage layer, validate requests to create `ResourceClaim` or `ResourceClaimTemplate` objects with `adminAccess: true`. Only authorize if namespace has the `kubernetes.io/dra-admin-access` label.

1. Grants privileged access to the requested device:

    For requests with `adminAccess: true`, the DRA controller bypasses standard allocation checks and allows administrators to access devices already in use. This ensures privileged tasks like monitoring or diagnostics can be performed without disrupting existing allocations. The controller also logs and audits admin-access requests for security and traceability.

1. No impact on availability of claims:

    The scheduler ignores claims with `adminAccess: true`, normal usage is not impacted as claims in other namespaces can still be allocated using the same devices that are also accessed by workloads in the admin namespace.

### Workflow

1. A cluster administrator labels a namespace with `kubernetes.io/dra-admin-access`.

1. Authorized users create `ResourceClaim` or `ResourceClaimTemplate` objects with `adminAccess: true`.

1. Only users with access to the admin namespace can use them in their pod spec.

1. The DRA controller processes the request and grants privileged access to the requested device.

## Design Details

### API Changes

Add `adminAccess` field to `DeviceRequest` which is part of `ResourceClaim` and `ResourceClaimTemplate`:

```go
// DeviceRequest is a request for devices required for a claim.
// This is typically a request for a single resource like a device, but can
// also ask for several identical devices.
//
// A DeviceClassName is currently required. Clients must check that it is
// indeed set. It's absence indicates that something changed in a way that
// is not supported by the client yet, in which case it must refuse to
// handle the request.
type DeviceRequest struct {
	// Name can be used to reference this request in a pod.spec.containers[].resources.claims
	// entry and in a constraint of the claim.
	//
	// Must be a DNS label.
	//
	// +required
	Name string `json:"name" protobuf:"bytes,1,name=name"`

	// DeviceClassName references a specific DeviceClass, which can define
	// additional configuration and selectors to be inherited by this
	// request.
	//
	// A class is required. Which classes are available depends on the cluster.
	//
	// Administrators may use this to restrict which devices may get
	// requested by only installing classes with selectors for permitted
	// devices. If users are free to request anything without restrictions,
	// then administrators can create an empty DeviceClass for users
	// to reference.
	//
	// +required
	DeviceClassName string `json:"deviceClassName" protobuf:"bytes,2,name=deviceClassName"`

	// Selectors define criteria which must be satisfied by a specific
	// device in order for that device to be considered for this
	// request. All selectors must be satisfied for a device to be
	// considered.
	//
	// +optional
	// +listType=atomic
	Selectors []DeviceSelector `json:"selectors,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,3,name=selectors"`

	// AllocationMode and its related fields define how devices are allocated
	// to satisfy this request. Supported values are:
	//
	// - ExactCount: This request is for a specific number of devices.
	//   This is the default. The exact number is provided in the
	//   count field.
	//
	// - All: This request is for all of the matching devices in a pool.
	//   Allocation will fail if some devices are already allocated,
	//   unless adminAccess is requested.
	//
	// If AlloctionMode is not specified, the default mode is ExactCount. If
	// the mode is ExactCount and count is not specified, the default count is
	// one. Any other requests must specify this field.
	//
	// More modes may get added in the future. Clients must refuse to handle
	// requests with unknown modes.
	//
	// +optional
	AllocationMode DeviceAllocationMode `json:"allocationMode,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,4,opt,name=allocationMode"`

	// Count is used only when the count mode is "ExactCount". Must be greater than zero.
	// If AllocationMode is ExactCount and this field is not specified, the default is one.
	//
	// +optional
	// +oneOf=AllocationMode
	Count int64 `json:"count,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,5,opt,name=count"`

	// AdminAccess indicates that this is a claim for administrative access
	// to the device(s). Claims with AdminAccess are expected to be used for
	// monitoring or other management services for a device.  They ignore
	// all ordinary claims to the device with respect to access modes and
	// any resource allocations.
	//
	// This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DRAAdminAccess
	// feature gate. Admin access is disabled if this field is unset or
	// set to false, otherwise it is enabled.
	//
	// +optional
	// +featureGate=DRAAdminAccess
	AdminAccess *bool `json:"adminAccess,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,6,opt,name=adminAccess"`
}
```

Admin access to devices is a privileged operation because it grants users
access to devices that are in use by other users. Drivers might also remove
other restrictions when preparing the device. 

In Kubernetes 1.31 (before this KEP was introduced), an example validating admission policy [was
provided](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4aeaf1e99e82da8334c0d6dddd848a194cd44b4f/test/e2e/dra/test-driver/deploy/example/admin-access-policy.yaml#L1-L11)
which restricts access to this option. It is the responsibility of cluster
admins to ensure that such a policy is installed if the cluster shouldn't allow
unrestricted access.

Starting in Kubernetes 1.33 (when this KEP was introduced), a validation has been added to the REST storage layer to only authorize `ResourceClaim` or `ResourceClaimTemplate` with `adminAccess: true` requests if their namespace has the `kubernetes.io/dra-admin-access` label to only allow it for users with additional privileges. More time is needed to
figure out how that should work, therefore the field is placed behind the `DRAAdminAccess` feature gate.

The `DRAAdminAccess` feature gate controls whether users can set the `adminAccess` field to
true when requesting devices. That is checked in the apiserver. In addition,
the scheduler will not allocate claims with admin access when the feature is
turned off, or if the field was set prior to the feature gate was introduced (for example, set in 1.31 when it
was available unconditionally, or if the field was set while the feature gate was enabled).
A similar check in the kube-controller-manager prevents creating a
ResourceClaim when the ResourceClaimTemplate has the `adminAccess` field while the feature gate is turned off.

### REST Storage Changes

In both pkg/registry/resource/resourceclaim/strategy.go and pkg/registry/resource/resourceclaimtemplate/strategy.go, add the following to `Validate` and `ValidateUpdate`:

```go
func (s resourceClaimTemplateStrategy) Validate(ctx context.Context, obj runtime.Object) field.ErrorList {
	resourceClaimTemplate := obj.(*resource.ResourceClaimTemplate)
	allErrs := authorizedForAdmin(ctx, resourceClaimTemplate, s.namespaceRest)
	return append(allErrs, validation.ValidateResourceClaimTemplate(resourceClaimTemplate)...)
}
```

and add `authorizedForAdmin` to check if the request is authorized to get admin access to devices based on the DRA admin namespace label:

```go
func authorizedForAdmin(ctx context.Context, template *resource.ResourceClaimTemplate, namespaceRest NamespaceGetter) field.ErrorList {
	// omitted

	for i := range template.Spec.Spec.Devices.Requests {
		value := template.Spec.Spec.Devices.Requests[i].AdminAccess
		if value != nil && *value {
			adminRequested = true
			break
		}
	}
	if !adminRequested {
		// No need to validate unless admin access is requested
		return allErrs
	}
	if namespaceRest == nil {
		return append(allErrs, field.Forbidden(field.NewPath(""), "namespace store is nil"))
	}

	namespaceName := template.Namespace
	// Retrieve the namespace object from the store
	obj, err := namespaceRest.Get(ctx, namespaceName, &metav1.GetOptions{ResourceVersion: "0"})
	if err != nil {
		return append(allErrs, field.Forbidden(field.NewPath(""), "namespace object cannot be retrieved"))
	}
	ns, ok := obj.(*core.Namespace)
	if !ok {
		return append(allErrs, field.Forbidden(field.NewPath(""), "namespace object is not of type core.Namespace"))
	}
	if value, exists := ns.Labels[DRAAdminNamespaceLabel]; !(exists && value == "true") {
		return append(allErrs, field.Forbidden(field.NewPath(""), "admin access to devices is not allowed in namespace without DRA Admin Access label"))
	}

	return allErrs
}
```

### Kube-controller-manager Changes

In pkg/controller/resourceclaim/controller.go, process `ResourceClaim` in `syncClaim` function to check for the `adminAccess` field and bypass allocation checks if `adminAccess: true`.

```go
func (ec *Controller) syncClaim(ctx context.Context, namespace, name string) error {
	logger := klog.LoggerWithValues(klog.FromContext(ctx), "claim", klog.KRef(namespace, name))
	ctx = klog.NewContext(ctx, logger)
	claim, err := ec.claimLister.ResourceClaims(namespace).Get(name)
	if err != nil {
		if apierrors.IsNotFound(err) {
			logger.V(5).Info("nothing to do for claim, it is gone")
			return nil
		}
		return err
	}
	adminRequested := false
	// Check for adminAccess flag
	for i := range claim.Spec.Devices.Requests {
		value := claim.Spec.Devices.Requests[i].AdminAccess
		if value != nil && *value {
			adminRequested = true
			break
		}
	}
	if adminRequested {
		logger.V(5).Info("ResourceClaim", klog.KRef(claim.Namespace, claim.Name), "has admin access, bypass standard allocation checks")
    claim.Status.Allocation = &resourceapi.AllocationResult{}
		return nil
	}

  // TODO: what part of claim.Status.Allocation should be updated? e.g. AdminAccess is part of DeviceRequestAllocationResult but need to set it for each device?

  // omitted
  ```

In pkg/controller/resourceclaim/controller.go, process requests in `handleClaim` functino to prevent creation of
`ResourceClaim` when the `ResourceClaimTemplate` has the `adminAccess` field while the feature gate is turned off:

```go

// handleClaim is invoked for each resource claim of a pod.
func (ec *Controller) handleClaim(ctx context.Context, pod *v1.Pod, podClaim v1.PodResourceClaim, newPodClaims *map[string]string) error {
	//omitted
	if claim == nil {
		template, err := ec.templateLister.ResourceClaimTemplates(pod.Namespace).Get(*templateName)
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("resource claim template %q: %v", *templateName, err)
		}

		if !ec.adminAccessEnabled && needsAdminAccess(template) {
			return errors.New("admin access is requested, but the feature is disabled")
		}

		// omitted
		claim = &resourceapi.ResourceClaim{
			ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{
				GenerateName: generateName,
				OwnerReferences: []metav1.OwnerReference{
					{
						APIVersion:         "v1",
						Kind:               "Pod",
						Name:               pod.Name,
						UID:                pod.UID,
						Controller:         &isTrue,
						BlockOwnerDeletion: &isTrue,
					},
				},
				Annotations: annotations,
				Labels:      template.Spec.ObjectMeta.Labels,
			},
			Spec: template.Spec.Spec,
		}
		metrics.ResourceClaimCreateAttempts.Inc()
		claimName := claim.Name
		claim, err = ec.kubeClient.ResourceV1beta1().ResourceClaims(pod.Namespace).Create(ctx, claim, metav1.CreateOptions{})
		if err != nil {
			metrics.ResourceClaimCreateFailures.Inc()
			return fmt.Errorf("create ResourceClaim %s: %v", claimName, err)
		}
		logger.V(4).Info("Created ResourceClaim", "claim", klog.KObj(claim), "pod", klog.KObj(pod))
		ec.claimCache.Mutation(claim)
	}
  // omitted
	return nil
}

```

### Kube-scheduler Changes

In pkg/scheduler/framework/plugins/dynamicresources/allocateddevices.go, handle claims with AdminAccess:

```go
// foreachAllocatedDevice invokes the provided callback for each
// device in the claim's allocation result which was allocated
// exclusively for the claim.
//
// Devices allocated with admin access can be shared with other
// claims and are skipped without invoking the callback.
//
// foreachAllocatedDevice does nothing if the claim is not allocated.
func foreachAllocatedDevice(claim *resourceapi.ResourceClaim, cb func(deviceID structured.DeviceID)) {
	if claim.Status.Allocation == nil {
		return
	}
	for _, result := range claim.Status.Allocation.Devices.Results {
		if ptr.Deref(result.AdminAccess, false) {
			// Is not considered as allocated.
			continue
		}
		deviceID := structured.MakeDeviceID(result.Driver, result.Pool, result.Device)

		// None of the users of this helper need to abort iterating,
		// therefore it's not supported as it only would add overhead.
		cb(deviceID)
	}
}
```
### ResourceQuota

Requests asking for `adminAccess` contribute to the quota. In practice,
namespaces where such access is allowed will typically not have quotas
configured.

### Test Plan

<!--
[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

##### Unit tests

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.

- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/registry/resource/resourceclaimtemplate`: %

##### Integration tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:

We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
-->

End-to-end testing depends on a working resource driver and a container runtime
with CDI support. A [test
driver](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/test/e2e/dra/test-driver)
was developed as part of the overall DRA development effort. We have extended
this test driver to enable `DRAAdminAccess` feature gate and added tests to
ensure `ResourceClaim` or `ResourceClaimTemplate` with `adminAccess: true` requests are only authorized if their namespace has the `kubernetes.io/dra-admin-access` label as described in this KEP.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- Allowing time for feedback

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

The usual Kubernetes upgrade and downgrade strategy applies for in-tree
components.

### Version Skew Strategy

This feature affects the kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler. The kube-apiserver must validate requests containing `adminAccess: true` regardless of the version of other components.
The kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler should ignore `adminAccess: true` if they are at an older version that does not support it and process the field only if the feature gate is detected.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: DRAAdminAccess
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
    - kube-apiserver
    - kube-controller-manager
    - kube-scheduler

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Workloads which were deployed with admin access will continue
to run with it. They need to be deleted to remove usage of the feature.
If they were not running, then the feature gate checks in kube-scheduler will prevent
scheduling and in kube-controller-manager will prevent creating the ResourceClaim from
a ResourceClaimTemplate. In both cases, usage of the feature is prevented.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Workloads which were deployed with admin access enabled are not
affected by a rollback. If the pods were already running, they keep running. If
the pods were kept as unschedulable because the scheduler refused to allocate
claims, then they might now get scheduled.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Tests for apiserver are covering disabling the feature. A test
that the DaemonSet controller tolerates keeping pods as pending is added.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.

- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->
Will be considered for beta.

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the followingâ€”thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->
Will be considered for beta.

### Scalability

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No.

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

No.

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

Will be considered for beta.

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->
Will be considered for beta.

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

Will be considered for beta.

## Implementation History

- Kubernetes 1.33: KEP accepted as "provisional".

## Drawbacks

None.

## Alternatives

The following options were also considered:
* Validating Admission Policy (VAP): An example was added in 1.31. However this approach cannot be used to control access for an in-tree type because Kubernetes has no mechanism to apply a system VAP to all new clusters automatically and therefore it is not sufficient for conformance.
* Builtin admission controller: This is doable, but more work than the approach described in this KEP.
* RBAC++: This is not available yet, especially for the DRA timeframe.
