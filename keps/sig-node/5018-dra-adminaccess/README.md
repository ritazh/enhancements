## Summary

As the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) feature evolves, cluster administrators
require a privileged mode, referred to as DRAAdminAccess, to securely access
devices already in use by other users. This mode enables administrators to
perform tasks such as monitoring the health and status of all devices while
ensuring that regular users can only run containers on devices explicitly
claimed by their workloads.

This KEP proposes a mechanism for cluster administrators to mark a request in a
ResourceClaim or ResourceClaimTemplate with an admin access flag. This flag
allows privileged access to devices, enabling administrative tasks without
compromising security. Access to this mode is restricted to users authorized to
create ResourceClaim or ResourceClaimTemplate objects in namespaces marked with
the DRA admin label, ensuring that non-administrative users cannot misuse this
feature.

Note: Administrator workloads should not interfere with the application
workloads. If that cannot be supported due to hardware restrictions or that the
administrator workload is too demanding, then administrators should request
exclusive access for specific admin task such that no other claims are
allocated.

## Motivation

The current Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) feature enables users to request
resources but lacks a mechanism for cluster administrators to gain privileged
access to devices already in use by other users. This limitation restricts
administrators from performing tasks like:

- Monitoring device health or status.

- Performing diagnostics and troubleshooting on devices shared across users.

Enabling such administrative tasks without compromising security is critical to
cluster operations. Non-admin users gaining access to devices in use by others
could result in:

- Unauthorized access to confidential information about device usage.

- Potential conflicts or misuse of shared hardware.

As the adoption of DRA expands, the inability of administrators to perform
privileged device introspection becomes a bottleneck for cluster operations,
particularly in shared environments where devices are critical resources.

### Goals

- Provide a privileged mode for cluster administrators to access devices already
  in use.

- Ensure that only authorized users can use the privileged mode.

- Maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to devices.

### Non-Goals

- Redesign DRA.

- Extend privileged mode access to non-admin users.

- Define how administrators use the data accessed through privileged mode.

- Define which specific additional permissions are enabled by DRA drivers when
  this privileged mode is used.

## Proposal

### DRAAdminAccess Overview

This proposal enhances the `DRAAdminAccess` feature to enable cluster
administrators to mark requests in `ResourceClaim` and `ResourceClaimTemplate`
objects as privileged. This feature includes:

1. Admin Access Flag:

   A field in `ResourceClaim` and `ResourceClaimTemplate` specifications to
   indicate the request is in admin mode.

   Example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: ResourceClaim
   metadata:
     name: admin-resource-claim
     namespace: admin-namespace
   spec:
     resourceClassName: admin-resource-class
     adminAccess: true
   ```

1. Namespace Label for DRA Admin Mode:

   Namespaces must be labeled to allow the creation of admin-access claims.

   Example label:

   ```yaml
   metadata:
     labels:
       kubernetes.io/dra-admin-access: "true"
   ```

1. Authorization Check:

   In the REST storage layer, validate requests to create `ResourceClaim` or
   `ResourceClaimTemplate` objects with `adminAccess: true`. Only authorize if
   namespace has the `kubernetes.io/dra-admin-access` label.

1. Grants privileged access to the requested device:

   For requests with `adminAccess: true`, the scheduler bypasses standard
   allocation checks and allows administrators to access devices already in use.
   This ensures privileged tasks like monitoring or diagnostics can be performed
   without disrupting existing allocations.

1. No impact on availability of claims:

   The scheduler ignores claims with `adminAccess: true`, normal usage is not
   impacted as claims in other namespaces can still be allocated using the same
   devices that are also accessed by workloads in the admin namespace.

### Workflow

1. A cluster administrator labels an admin namespace with
   `kubernetes.io/dra-admin-access`.

1. Only authorized users can create `ResourceClaim` or `ResourceClaimTemplate`
   objects with `adminAccess: true` in this admin namespace.

1. Only users with access to the admin namespace can reference these
   `ResourceClaims` or `ResourceClaimTemplates` in their pod or deployment
   specs.

1. The DRA controller processes the request and grants privileged access to the
   requested device.

## Design Details

### API Changes

The `adminAccess` field in `DeviceRequest` was added to `ResourceClaim` and
`ResourceClaimTemplate` in Kubernetes v1.31:

```go
// DeviceRequest is a request for devices required for a claim.
// This is typically a request for a single resource like a device, but can
// also ask for several identical devices.
//
// A DeviceClassName is currently required. Clients must check that it is
// indeed set. It's absence indicates that something changed in a way that
// is not supported by the client yet, in which case it must refuse to
// handle the request.
type DeviceRequest struct {
	...

    // AdminAccess indicates that this is a claim for administrative access
    // to the device(s). Claims with AdminAccess are expected to be used for
    // monitoring or other management services for a device.  They ignore
    // all ordinary claims to the device with respect to access modes and
    // any resource allocations.
    //
    // This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DRAAdminAccess
    // feature gate. Admin access is disabled if this field is unset or
    // set to false, otherwise it is enabled.
    //
    // +optional
    // +featureGate=DRAAdminAccess
    AdminAccess *bool
}
```

Admin access to devices is a privileged operation because it grants users access
to devices that are in use by other users. Drivers might also remove other
restrictions when preparing the device.

In Kubernetes 1.31 (before this KEP was introduced), an example validating
admission policy
[was provided](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4aeaf1e99e82da8334c0d6dddd848a194cd44b4f/test/e2e/dra/test-driver/deploy/example/admin-access-policy.yaml#L1-L11)
which restricts access to this option. It is the responsibility of cluster
admins to ensure that such a policy is installed if the cluster shouldn't allow
unrestricted access.

Starting in Kubernetes 1.33 (when this KEP was introduced), a validation has
been added to the REST storage layer to only authorize `ResourceClaim` or
`ResourceClaimTemplate` with `adminAccess: true` requests if their namespace has
the `kubernetes.io/dra-admin-access` label to only allow it for users with
additional privileges. More time is needed to figure out how that should work,
therefore the field is placed behind the `DRAAdminAccess` feature gate.

The `DRAAdminAccess` feature gate controls whether users can set the
`adminAccess` field to true when requesting devices. That is checked in the
apiserver. In addition, the scheduler will not allocate claims with admin access
when the feature is turned off. This covers the scenario that the field might
have been set in Kubernetes v1.31 where the field was available uncondiionally
or while the feature was enabled.

### REST Storage Changes

In both pkg/registry/resource/resourceclaim/strategy.go and
pkg/registry/resource/resourceclaimtemplate/strategy.go, update `Validate` and
`ValidateUpdate` to call a new `authorizedForAdmin` function to check if the
request is authorized to set the `adminAccess` field to devices based on the DRA
admin namespace label.

### Kube-controller-manager Changes

In pkg/controller/resourceclaim/controller.go, process `ResourceClaim` in
`syncClaim` function to check for the `adminAccess` field and the feature gate
enablement to ensure the field can be set.

// TODO: what part of claim.Status.Allocation should be updated? e.g.
AdminAccess is part of `DeviceRequestAllocationResult` but need to set it for
each device?

In pkg/controller/resourceclaim/controller.go, process requests in `handleClaim`
function to prevent creation of `ResourceClaim` when the `ResourceClaimTemplate`
has the `adminAccess` field while the feature gate is turned off.

### Kube-scheduler Changes

In pkg/scheduler/framework/plugins/dynamicresources/allocateddevices.go, handle
claims with `adminAccess` to ensure devices allocated with `adminAccess` are
skipped without invoking the callback bypassing standard allocation checks.

### ResourceQuota

Requests asking for `adminAccess` contribute to the quota. We recommend that
these administrator namespaces should not have quotas configured.

### Test Plan

<!--
[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes
necessary to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

##### Unit tests

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
- `<package>`: `<date>` - `<test coverage>`
-->

Start of v1.33 development cycle (v1.33.0-alpha.1-):

- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/registry/resource/resourceclaim`: %
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/registry/resource/resourceclaimtemplate`: %

##### Integration tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
-->

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html

We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
-->

End-to-end testing depends on a working resource driver and a container runtime
with CDI support. A
[test driver](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/test/e2e/dra/test-driver)
was developed as part of the overall DRA development effort. We have extended
this test driver to enable `DRAAdminAccess` feature gate and added tests to
ensure `ResourceClaim` or `ResourceClaimTemplate` with `adminAccess: true`
requests are only authorized if their namespace has the
`kubernetes.io/dra-admin-access` label as described in this KEP.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

The usual Kubernetes upgrade and downgrade strategy applies for in-tree
components.

### Version Skew Strategy

This feature affects the kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and
kube-scheduler. The kube-apiserver must validate requests containing
`adminAccess: true` regardless of the version of other components. The
kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler should ignore `adminAccess: true` if
they are at an older version that does not support it and process the field only
if the feature gate is detected.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: DRAAdminAccess
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
    - kube-apiserver
    - kube-controller-manager
    - kube-scheduler

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Workloads which were deployed with admin access will continue to run with it.
They need to be deleted to remove usage of the feature. If they were not
running, then the feature gate checks in kube-scheduler will prevent scheduling
and in kube-controller-manager will prevent creating the ResourceClaim from a
ResourceClaimTemplate. In both cases, usage of the feature is prevented.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Workloads which were deployed with admin access enabled are not affected by a
rollback. If the pods were already running, they keep running. If the pods were
kept as unschedulable because the scheduler refused to allocate claims, then
they might now get scheduled.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Tests for apiserver are covering disabling the feature. A test that the
DaemonSet controller tolerates keeping pods as pending is added.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

Will be considered for beta.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

Will be considered for beta.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

Will be considered for beta.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

Will be considered for beta.

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

Will be considered for beta.

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

Will be considered for beta.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason:
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name:
  - Other field:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:
-->

Will be considered for beta.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->

Will be considered for beta.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.

- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:
-->

Will be considered for beta.

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

Will be considered for beta.

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the followingâ€”thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

Will be considered for beta.

### Scalability

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No.

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

No.

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

Will be considered for beta.

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->

Will be considered for beta.

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

Will be considered for beta.

## Implementation History

- Kubernetes 1.33: KEP accepted as "provisional".

## Drawbacks

None.

## Alternatives

The following options were also considered:

- Validating Admission Policy (VAP): An example was added in 1.31. However this
  approach cannot be used to control access for an in-tree type because
  Kubernetes has no mechanism to apply a system VAP to all new clusters
  automatically and therefore it is not sufficient for conformance.
- Builtin admission controller: This is doable, but more work than the approach
  described in this KEP.
- RBAC++: This is not available yet, especially for the DRA timeframe.
