## Summary

This KEP proposes the new v2alpha1 `KeyManagementService` service contract to:
- enable fully automated key rotation for the latest key
- improve KMS plugin health check reliability
- improve observability of envelop operations between kube-apiserver, KMS plugins and KMS

It further proposes a SIG-Auth maintained KMS plugin reference implementation. This implementation will support a key hierarchy design that implements the v2alpha1 API and will serve as a baseline that provides:
- improve readiness times for clusters with a large number of encrypted resources
- reduce the likelihood of hitting the external KMS request rate limit
- metrics and tracing support

## Motivation

**Performance**: Today, when the kube-apiserver is restarted in a cluster and a LIST secret call is made (this applies to all resources encrypted at rest, which secrets tend to always be part of), due to the serial processing of LIST requests and the data encryption key (DEK) cache being empty, the initialization of informers may take significant time as a result of the large number of consecutive trips to the KMS plugin -> external KMS for all the DEKs that have been generated so far. This serial call can cause the KMS plugin to hit the external KMS rate limit and delay the overall readiness of the cluster. Currently, a DEK is generated for each object and is then encrypted using a KEK. This 1:1 mapping means if there is a burst of secret creation, then the KMS plugin can also hit the external KMS rate limit for encrypt operations.

**Rotation**: Currently, it requires lots of manual steps to [rotate a KMS key for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/#rotating-a-decryption-key) and the process is error prone. It requires deployment of another instance of the KMS plugin with the new key running side by side with the old instance while adding a second entry of the new plugin to `EncryptionConfiguration`. Any change to the `EncryptionConfiguration` requires a kube-apiserver restart for the changes to take effect. For a single kube-apiserver configuration, this can lead to a brief period when the kube-apiserver is unavailable. The current rotation process requires multiple restarts of all kube-apiserver processes to ensure each server can decrypt and then encrypt using the new key. It requires multiple updates to the `EncryptionConfiguration`  to move the new key to the second and then first entry in the keys array so that it is used for encryption in the config. It also requires running storage migration (either via the storage version migrator or a manual invocation of `kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f - `) to encrypt all existing Secrets with the new key, which can timeout and leave the cluster in a state where it is still dependent on the old key.

**Health Check & Status**: Today, the health check from kube-apiserver to KMS plugin is an `Encrypt` operation followed by `Decrypt` operation. These operations cost money in cloud environments and do not allow the plugin to perform more holistic checks on if it is healthy. Furthermore, a plugin has no way to inform the API server if its underlying key encryption key (KEK) has been rotated. If we provide a separate status RPC call with its own `StatusRequest` and `StatusResponse`, the KMS plugin can indicate the change in KEK version as part of response. This could be an indication that the KEK is now rotated and storage migration is now required.

**Observability**: The only way to correlate a successful/failed envelope operation today is to use the approximate timestamp of the operation to check events in kube-apiserver, kms-plugin and KMS. There is no guarantee that the timestamp of the operation is the same as the timestamp of the corresponding event in KMS. This KEP proposes extending the signature of the kms-plugin interface to include the transaction ID (to be generated by the kube-apiserver), which kms-plugin could pass to KMS. This transaction ID will be logged in the kube-apiserver with additional metadata such as secret name and namespace for the envelope operation. Similarly, the transaction ID will be logged in the kms-plugin and optionally passed to KMS.

### Goals
- improve readiness times for clusters with a large number of encrypted resources
- reduce the likelihood of hitting the KMS rate limit
- enable fully automated key rotation for the latest key
- improve KMS plugin health check reliability
- improve observability of envelop operations between kube-apiserver, KMS plugins and KMS
- if this v2 API reaches GA in release N, the existing v1beta1 gRPC API will be deprecated at release N and removed at release N+3 (the existing key rotation dance of using multiple providers will be used to migrate from v1beta1 to v2)

### Non-Goals
- Prevent KMS rate limiting
- Recovery when KMS KEK is deleted
- Using the proposed transaction ID for audit logging

## Proposal

Performance, Health Check, Observability and Rotation:
- Support key hierarchy in KMS plugin that generates local KEK
- Expand `EncryptionConfiguration` to support a new KMSv2 configuration
- Add v2alpha1 `KeyManagementService` proto service contract in Kubernetes to include
    - `key_id` and additional metadata in `annotations` to support key rotation
    - `key_id`: the KMS Key ID, stable identifier, changed to trigger key rotation and storage migration
    - `annotations`: structured data, can contain the encrypted local KEK, can be used for debugging, recovery, opaque to API server, stored unencrypted, etc. Validation similar to how K8s labels are validated today. Labels have good size limits and restrictions today.
    - A status request and response periodically (order of minutes) returns `version`, `healthz`, and `key_id`
    - The `key_id` in status can be used on decrypt operations to compare and validate the key ID stored in the DEK cache and the latest `EncryptResponse` `key_id` to detect if an object is stale in terms of storage migration
    - Generate a new UID for each envelope operation in kube-apiserver
    - Add a new UID field to `EncryptRequest` and `DecryptRequest`
- Add support for hot reload of the `EncryptionConfiguration`:
    - Watch on the `EncryptionConfiguration`
    - When changes are detected, process the `EncryptionConfiguration` resource, and add new transformers and update existing ones atomically.
    - If there is an issue with creating or updating any of the transformers, retain the current configuration in the kube-apiserver and generate an error in logs.
- Enable fully automated rotation for `latest` key in KMS:
    > NOTE: Prerequisite: `EncryptionConfiguration` is set up to always use the `latest` key version in KMS and the values can be interpreted dynamically at runtime by the KMS plugin to hot reload the current write key. Rotation process sequence:
    - record initial key ID across all API servers (this could be recorded in the `StorageVersionStatus` as a new field)
    - cause key rotation in KMS (user action in the remote KMS)
    - observe the change across the stack (wait for convergence of `StorageVersionStatus`)
    - storage migration (run storage migrator)

`EncryptionConfiguration` will be expanded to support the new v2 API:

Support key hierarchy in KMS plugin that generates local KEK and add v2alpha1 `KeyManagementService` proto service contract in Kubernetes to include `key_id`, `annotations`, and `status`. 

Key Hierarchy in KMS plugin (reference implementation):

1. No changes to the API server, keep 1:1 DEK mapping
    1. Assumption: A KMS plugin that was implemented using a local HSM would not need any changes because it would be able to handle the amount of encryption calls with ease since it would not need to perform network IO
    1. Assumption: local gRPC calls to the KMS plugin do not represent significant overhead
1. KMS plugin generates its own local KEK in-memory
1. External KMS is used to encrypt the local KEK
1. Local KEK is used for encryption of DEKs sent by API server
1. Local KEK is used for encryption based on policy (N events, X time, etc)

Since key hierarchy is implemented at the KMS plugin level, it should be seamless for the kube-apiserver. So whether the plugin is using a key hierarchy or not, the kube-apiserver should behave the same.

What is required of the kube-apiserver is to be able to tell the KMS plugin which KEK (local KEK or KMS KEK) it should use to decrypt the incoming DEK. To do so, upon encryption, the KMS plugin could provide the encrypted local KEK as part of the `annotations` field in the `EncryptResponse`. The kube-apiserver would then store it in etcd next to the DEK. Upon decryption, the kube-apiserver provides the encrypted local KEK in `annotations` and `observed_key_id` from the last encryption when calling Decrypt. In case no encrypted local KEK is provided in the `annotations`, then we can assume key hierarchy is not used. The KMS plugin would query the external KMS to use the remote KEK to decrypt the DEK (same behavior as today). No state coordination is required between different instances of the KMS plugin.

For the reference KMS plugin, the encrypted local KEK is stored in etcd via the `annotations` field, and once decrypted, it can be stored in memory as part of the KMS plugin cache to be used for encryption and decryption of DEKs. The encrypted local KEK is used as the key and the decrypted local KEK is stored as the value.

```proto
message EncryptResponse {
    // The encrypted data.
    bytes ciphertext = 1;
    // The KMS key ID used for encryption operations.
    // This can be used to drive rotation.
    string key_id = 2;
    // Additional metadata to be stored with the encrypted data.
    // The annotations can contain the encrypted local KEK that was used to encrypt the DEK.
    // Stored unencrypted in etcd.
    map<string, bytes> annotations = 3;
}
```

The `DecryptRequest` passes the same `key_id` and `annotations` returned by the previous `EncryptResponse` of this data as its `observed_key_id` and `metadata` for the decryption request.

```proto
message DecryptRequest {
    // The data to be decrypted.
    bytes ciphertext = 1;
    // UID is a unique identifier for the request.
    string uid = 2;
    // The keyID that was provided to the apiserver during encryption.
    // This represents the KMS KEK that was used to encrypt the data.
    string observed_key_id = 3;
    // Additional metadata that was sent by the KMS plugin during encryption.
    map<string, bytes> annotations = 4;
}

message DecryptResponse {
    // The decrypted data.
    bytes plaintext = 1;
    // The KMS key ID used to decrypt the data.
    string key_id = 2;
    // Additional metadata that was sent by the KMS plugin.
    map<string, bytes> annotations = 3;
}

message EncryptRequest {
    // The data to be encrypted.
    bytes plaintext = 1;
    // UID is a unique identifier for the request.
    string uid = 2;
}
```

In terms of storage, a new structured protobuf format is proposed. Similar to the proto serializer, it will use a magic number to detect when the stored data is in a format that it understands:

```go
encryptedProtoEncodingPrefix = []byte{'e', 'k', '8', 's', 0}
```

The last byte represents the encoding style, with 0 meaning that the rest of the byte stream is a proto message of type `EncryptedObject`:

```go
type EncryptedObject struct {
    TypeMeta `json:",inline" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=typeMeta"`

    KeyID string `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=keyID"`

    PluginName string `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=pluginName"`

    Ciphertext []byte `protobuf:"bytes,4,opt,name=ciphertext"`

    Annotations map[string][]byte `protobuf:"bytes,5,opt,name=annotations"`
}
```

This object simply provides a structured format to store the `EncryptResponse` data with the plugin name and encrypted object data. New fields can easily be added to this format.

To improve health check reliability, the new StatusResponse provides version, healthz information, and can trigger key rotation via storage version status updates.

```proto
message StatusRequest {}

message StatusResponse {
    // Version of the KMS plugin API.
    string version = 1;

    // anything other than "ok" is failing healthz
    string healthz = 2;

    // the current write key, can be used to trigger rotation
    string key_id = 3;
}
```

The `key_id` may be funneled into the storage version status as another field that API servers can attempt to gain consensus on:

> NOTE: Since the storage version API is still alpha, this KEP will simply aim to make it possible to have automated rotation when that API is enabled and has been updated to include the new fields. The rotation feature will first be scoped to a single API server and will not be part of the graduation criteria for this KEP.

To improve observability, this design also generates a new `UID` for each envelope operation similar to `UID` generation in admission review requests here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/e9e669aa6037c380469b45200e59cff9b52d6d68/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/admission/plugin/webhook/request/admissionreview.go#L137.

This `UID` field is included in the `EncryptRequest` and `DecryptRequest` of the v2 API.  It will always be present. It is generated in the kube-apiserver and will be used:

1. For logging in the kube-apiserver. All envelope operations to the kms-plugin will be logged with the corresponding `UID`.
   1. The `UID` will be logged using a wrapper in the kube-apiserver to ensure that the `UID` is logged in the same format and is always logged.
   2. In addition to the `UID`, the kube-apiserver will also log non-sensitive metadata such as `name`, `namespace` and `GroupVersionResource` of the object that triggered the envelope operation.
2. Sent to the kms-plugin as part of the `EncryptRequest` and `DecryptRequest` structs.

### Test Plan

[ ] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

This section is incomplete and will be updated before the beta milestone.

##### Unit tests

This section is incomplete and will be updated before the beta milestone.

##### Integration tests

This section is incomplete and will be updated before the beta milestone.

##### e2e tests

This section is incomplete and will be updated before the beta milestone.

### Graduation Criteria

Since the storage version API is still alpha, this KEP will simply aim to make it possible to have automated rotation when that API is enabled and has been updated to include the new fields.  The rotation feature will first be scoped to a single API server and will not be part of the graduation criteria for this KEP because the storage version API will take time to mature. However, testing of rotation will be part of the graduation criteria to confirm that the right information is being made available to allow for automated rotation when the storage version API graduates.

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial unit and integration tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.
-->

- Feature gate
  - Feature gate name: `KMSv2`
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
    - kube-apiserver

```go
FeatureSpec{
	Default: false,
	LockToDefault: false,
	PreRelease: featuregate.Alpha,
}
```

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No.  The v2 API is new in the v1.25 release.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes, via the `KMSv2` feature gate. Disabling this gate without first doing a storage migration to use a different encryption at rest mechanism will result in data loss.

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: Logs in kube-apiserver, kms-plugin and KMS will be logged with the corresponding `observed_key_id`, `annotations`, and `UID`.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

There should be no impact on the SLO with this change.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: Logs in kube-apiserver, kms-plugin and KMS will be logged with the corresponding `observed_key_id`, `annotations`, and `UID`.

### Dependencies

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

No.

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

Yes, the new KMS v2 gRPC API.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

Yes, the new KMS v2 gRPC types.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

No, the v2 API is new.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No.

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

- ETCD data encryption with external kms-plugin is unavailable

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->
**Performance and rotation:**

We considered the follow approaches and each has its own drawbacks:
1. `cacheSize` field in `EncryptionConfiguration`. It is used by the API server to initialize a LRU cache of the given size with the encrypted ciphertext used as index. Having a higher value for the `cacheSize` will prevent calls to the plugin for decryption operations. However, this does not solve the issue with the number of calls to KMS plugin when encryption traffic is bursty.
2. Reduce the number of trips to KMS by caching DEKs by allowing one DEK to be used to encrypt multiple objects within the configured TTL period. One issue with this approach is it will be very hard to inform the API server to rotate the DEKs when a KEK has been rotated. 

**Observability**:

We considered using the `AuditID` from the kube-apiserver request that generated the envelope operation. This approach has the following drawbacks:

1. `AuditID` can be configured by the user with the `Audit-ID` header in the API server request. Multiple requests can be sent to the kube-apiserver with the same `Audit-ID`.
2. Not all API server requests will generate an envelope operation. The API server caches DEKs and for the DEK that's available in the cache, the kube-apiserver will not generate an envelope operation.
3. Since not all calls to the KMS correspond to an audit log, using audit ID is not complete for correlating calls from kube-apiserver->kms-plugin->KMS.

## Infrastructure Needed

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
-->
We need a new git repo for the KMS plugin reference implementation. It will need to be synced from the k/k staging dir.
